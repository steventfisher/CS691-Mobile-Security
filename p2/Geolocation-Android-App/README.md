# Geolocation Android App
## CS691 Project 2
This was the second project written for CS 691(Mobile Privacy and Security)
at UNR

This project will need to be updated in order to utilize newer versions of 
Android SDK.

This project was an example of how to implement geolocation data within
an app.  From this location data there would be suggestions on business
that are available within the area.
