# Firebase Android App
## CS691 Project 3

This was the third project written for CS 691(Mobile Privacy and Security) at UNR

This project will need to be updated in order to utilize newer versions of Android SDK.

This project was an example of how to implement the firebase API for Android.  Here we
implemented the login interface for Android apps.
